                    <p>I have learned in my 47 years on this planet, what is truly important to me and that is family. Whether that be my work family, my blood family, my tribal family, or my friend family...Family comes first. </p>
               <br>

                    Always.

                    My husband and I were high school sweethearts. We have been together for thirty years. We have two amazing children together.  They are 23 and 18. One is studying to be a Doctor at the UW and the other is a senior in High School, hoping to go on the "Disc-golf Pro-Tour" after graduation.

                    I make steampunk creations and Native treasures(with powerful protections put on them for negating dark energy). While Scott, My husband, makes magic wands. Staffs. sculptures. and beautiful paintings.

                    I believe the best work is : TeamWork!
                    They say there is no I in team...so I struggle with how to tell you that "I" am a team player when "I" must be present...I actually believe the best teams are those that can work together without comprise to their own individualism...lol

                <p>
                <br>
                    I have an amazing sense of humor and it should be known I have been fired twice in my life for being "Happy ALL the time". You think I am joking. But being Happy is actually a deficit when it annoys 90 percent of humanity. Really gives you a perspective on Misery and how vast Her reach is, however, I continue to try to spread cheer and happiness because I feel blessed to be married to my best friend and have two amazing kids. A family who loves me. A job that keeps us a float. I will always look for the silver lining in situations and keep everyone spirits up threw tough or intense situations.
